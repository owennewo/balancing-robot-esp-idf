## Overview
This is a rewrite of Wouter Klopps excellent balancing robot: https://gitlab.com/kloppertje/balancingrobot

My motivations for the rewrite are:
 - to fully understand Wouter's code
   - I'll be reworking some libraries e.g. FlySkyI6 to Serial2 to UART
 - to improve my very poor c++ 
 - to move away from arduino framework to esp-idf framework
   - Everything will be FreeRtos xTask
   - Tasks will communicate with each other using xQueues
 - the hope is that this will lead to more modular code and easier to swap things out for future projects
